        double num1=20.6;
        double num2=10.5;
        double add=(num1+num2);
        double sub=(num1-num2);
        double mul=(num1*num2);
        double div=(num1/num2);
        System.out.println("The additional of 2 numbers "+num1+" and "+num2+" is equal to "+add);
        System.out.println("The additional of 2 numbers "+num1+" and "+num2+" is equal to "+sub);
        System.out.println("The additional of 2 numbers "+num1+" and "+num2+" is equal to "+mul);
        System.out.println("The additional of 2 numbers "+num1+" and "+num2+" is equal to "+
