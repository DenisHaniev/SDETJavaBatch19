Type casting:
Type casting is moving the data from on data type to another.When we move something from a
small data type to a large data type it's called auto/widening,implicit.
When we move something from a bigger box to a smaller box it is called Manual/narrowing/explcit.


when we combine the code from different sources we might need to perform this type casting to make the code
compatible.

Relational operators help us compare data .They always return results in the tru or fals.
== if something is same return true
!=if something is not same returns true
> if the value on left side is greater than  right side returns true
<  if the value on left side is smaller than  right side returns true
>= if the value on left side is greater or equal right side returns true
>=if the value on left side is smaller than  right side returns true


IF Statements оператор if
If Statements help the computer to execute the code conditionally.
Without if conditions all almost all the programs will be useless.

There ara many variations of these statements.

if Statements
one condition one action

if else Statements
one condition two actions.

if else if Statements
multiple conditions multiple actions.

Nested if Statements
When one condition is dependent on another condition that is when we use nested  if statements/
