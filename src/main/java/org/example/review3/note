logical Operators:
NOT(!)- revers boolean (from true to false and false to true)
OR(||)-OR helps us to combine multiple boolean conditions in away when one conditionds is try the over all is try.
AND(&&) AND helps us to combine conditions in a way that we only get an overall true when all the conditions are true/
