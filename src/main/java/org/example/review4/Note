Loops:
loops helps us repeat a block of code until and condition fails.There are 4 maine types of loops in java.
1)While loop
2)Do while loop
3)For loop
4)Enhanced for loops

While loop:
When we don't now the number of iterations beforehand while loop is the best type of loop to use in that scenario.
//For example when we are searching for a product from amazon we keep on clicking the next button  until we find it.

Do while loop:
 When we want to execute the body of the loop at least once before we check the condition that is when we
 should be using  the do while loop.

 For Loop: //When we know how manu numbers 4,10,100,1000 any number

 For loop is the better choice when we know the number of interations in advance .
 for example,we want to print the 10 numbers.

Array:
Array is a collection of multiple variables. Every variable is given a number called as index that we can use
to access that variable.
Array You can store more than 1 variables(5,10 100,1000)
